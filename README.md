# Homework 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

### Overview:
This is the fourth homework that is required for the University of Denver Coding Boot Camp.  The assignment was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions 
that will run in a web browser.   


#### Code: 
The website is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript fundamentals.  
1. When the quiz starts it has a timer. 
2. Multiple choice questions are presented and when one is answered another is presented. 
3. For every wrong answer 10 seconds is taken off the timer. 
4. The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer runs out. 
5. When the quiz ends it shows the score and allows you to post your initials and score in a list.

#### Summary:

This project taught me about traversing the DOM and creating, removing and hiding HTML elements dynamically with JavaScript.
I also learned how to use localStorage to store data and retain it even after the browser is closed.
